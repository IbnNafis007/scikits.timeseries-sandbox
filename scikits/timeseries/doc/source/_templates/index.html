  <h1>Welcome</h1>

  <p>The scikits.timeseries module provides classes and functions for
  manipulating, reporting, and plotting time series of various frequencies.
  The focus is on convenient data access and manipulation while leveraging
  the existing mathematical functionality in numpy and scipy.</p>

  <p>If the following scenarios sound familiar to you, then you will likely find
  the scikits.timeseries module useful:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Compare many time series with different ranges of data (eg. stock
        prices)</li>
    <li>Create time series plots with intelligently spaced axis labels</li>
    <li>Convert a daily time series to monthly by taking the average value
        during each month</li>
    <li>Work with data that has missing values</li>
    <li>Determine the last business day of the previous month/quarter/year for
        reporting purposes</li>
    <li>Compute a moving standard deviation <i>efficiently</i></li>
  </ul>

  <p>These are just some of the scenarios that are made very simple with the
  scikits.timeseries module.</p>
